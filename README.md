# quick-php-server

This provides a quick php dev server using docker. 

You will need to have Docker installed on your computer and be comfortable with Docker commands.

To use:

1) Clone and cd into the repository.
2) Type the docker-compose up -d command
3) You can now access the server from your browser at http://localhost:8100
4) Start coding! You can add/edit your php files within the php folder. You'll see an index.php file there to get you started.
